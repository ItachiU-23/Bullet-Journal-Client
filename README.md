This is **_Bullet Journal Application for Web_**

What's Done till now:-
=> Created ContentPage, LandingPage, RegisterPage, LoginPage, Navbar and also a component
to render lists.

=> The querying is done using the logged in user-id.

What's to be done:-
=> The querying should be done using the logged in user-id but the rendering of the data should
be based on the task/event/note created.

=> Basically it should be a grid of boxes with just dates on top to indicate which date it belongs to.

=> After clicking on specific box with a date then it shows a page where you can edit and modify
all your tasks, events, and notes.
